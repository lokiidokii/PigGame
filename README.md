# PigGame

<h3>About</h3>

<p>🐷 Based on the classic 2 player Pig dice game 🐷

- Users (2 players) take turns clicking "Roll Dice" to simulate rolling a 6-sided die 
- The dice roll is displayed in the center of the game for both players to see
- On a players turn, they may roll the die as many times as they like, choosing to hold the current score they have
- If a player doesn't hold, they risk losing all the points they accumulated while rolling when they roll a 1
- Once a 1 is rolled on the active players turn, the active player is switched 
- The game ends when a player reaches a score >= 100 
- Users have the option to reset the game when finished
