# PigGame

## Description

🐷 Based on the classic two-player 'Pig' dice game 🐷

## Instructions
Users (2 players) take turns clicking "Roll Dice" to simulate rolling a 6-sided die. The dice roll is displayed in the center of the game for both players to see. On a players turn, they may roll the die as many times as they like, choosing to hold the current score they have. If a player doesn't hold, they risk losing all the points they accumulated while rolling when they roll a 1. Once a 1 is rolled on the active players turn, the active player is switched. The game ends when a player reaches a score >= 100. Users then have the option to reset the game when finished.
